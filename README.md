## Background
Koala52 was designed to be a versatile yet simple keyboard.

Before designing Koala52, I was using the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) and the [Allium58](https://github.com/beekeeb/Allium58) for several years. They were excellent keyboards in their own regards, but I felt like I wanted to introduce some changes to make a keyboard that was more suitable for me. Most importantly, I wanted a smaller thumb cluster that felt comfortable for my thumbs. I wanted a thumb cluster that went slightly further outwards, without having to rely on either tucking or stretching my thumbs extensively. Moreover, I wanted much more aggressive column staggering, which matched my finger lengths better.

Inspiration was derived from various keyboards, most notably the [IK Keyboard](https://github.com/ianmaclarty/ik) which features a similar layout but with less pronounced stagger.

Contrary to many newer smaller split ergo keyboards, I decided to retain the fourth row to have a dedicated number row. This was primarily done to make it more suitable for gaming, since many games rely on the number row for switching between different items. If I wasn't playing games regularly, I would probably ditch the number row.

I've also decided to forego the common OLED screen, opting instead for a dedicated piezo speaker on each half. I made this choice because, based on my experience, the screen provides little value to a typist that normally doesn't look at their keyboard. Most screens screens are also toa small to be beneficial and perform poorly with steep tenting angles. They can however be visually pleasing, but my priority was a pragmatic design first and foremost.

I decided that I also needed a good tenting solution, which is why I added an inset at the bottom of the case for MagSafe compatibility. I considered other tenting solutions as well, but settled in the end on MagSafe since it combines versatility and simplicity. You aren't forced into using a tenting solution, and it can easily be adjusted based on your individual needs.
